# Cattle-Face-Re-Identification

To address the limitations of existing methods in modeling discriminative features for solid-colored cattle faces and the lack of a unified and efficient re-identification mechanism, this study proposes a two-stage cattle face re-identification method. The goal is to improve the identification performance for low-texture individuals while enhancing system stability and applicability in complex farming environments.In the detection stage, a lightweight model named Pruned Edge-enhanced Real-Time Detection Transformer (PrunedEdge-DETR) is developed. By integrating a multi-scale edge feature enhancement architecture with a grouped Taylor expansion pruning strategy, the model significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high detection accuracy. On the cattle face detection task, the model achieves 95.3% mAP50 with only 16.9G FLOPs and reaches an inference speed of 227.2 FPS, demonstrating excellent real-time performance.In the recognition stage, a dual-branch feature extraction network called Dual-channel fused MobileViT (DCFuseViT) is proposed, which integrates local contours, fine-grained textures, and global semantic features to effectively enhance the representation capability for low-distinctiveness individuals. To support efficient re-identification, a feature library-driven matching mechanism named EffiLibCatReID is further introduced. The method combines multi-stage vector compression and efficient cosine similarity computation based on matrix multiplication, forming an end-to-end optimized feature matching pipeline. enabling fast and accurate individual re-identification. Experimental results on the AngusDataset-128 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 97.8% re-identification accuracy with an average inference time of only 10.5 milliseconds per image, showing strong adaptability and deployment potential in low-texture cattle recognition scenarios.
